**For Sprint 1 work: feel free to look at sprint1 branch.**



Motivation: Our service learning partner requested that we investigate the various ways that countries around the world protect people's land rights, especially in certain northwestern African countries such as Liberia. Alfred, our community partner, would like to investigate government policies, laws/regulations/enforcements, and acquirements, in order to draw insights as to how best to protect individuals' land rights.

Data: We are exploring data from eight African countries: BurkinaFaso, Cameroon, Coted_Ivoire, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Zambia. For each of these countries, we have data from a survey responses (from a Land Alliance for Properties of People and Places) for approximately 84 questions. These survey responses are broken down into sections, based on areas involving: a general screening/background, respondent profile, tenure assessment of dwelling, tenure security perceptions, documentation, benefits of tenure security, and property rights context and perceptions.

For the purpose of this iteration, we chose to dive deeper into certain survey responses that kept track of citizens' perceptions of their land rights vs. the "true" security of their land, as determined by various indices described in a dataset from Landmark (A Global Platform of Indigenous and Community land). This Landmark data is a series of ten indicator questions that investigate the security of land tenure for indigenous communities. Each indicator is determined based on a review of several related factors such as national laws, regulations, statutes, etc. The indicators are then scored from 1 - 4 based on how much the relevant laws address the issues at hand, (one being highest, four being lowest in the sense that the laws do not address the issue).

The indicator scores are all numeric, and all the countries are categorical. In addition, the survey responses that we explored are also numeric, as we compiled the total counts for each question's possible responses, in order to visualize their distributions.

Task Analysis: During our interview with Alfred (our community partner), we decided to ask him about his specific goals regarding the indices, and we found that he is trying to determine a ranking that can help NGO's drive reform. He is looking to develop an index that can better inform NGO's about ways to help citizens of the various African countries have a clearer idea of their land rights and defend them in the most effective ways.

Design Iterations (past sketches -> final design): TBD

Visualization/Justifications/packages/UI walkthrough: TBD
We are using JS/HTML/CSS for the UI.
As of now, we can read in the data from the CSV files and would like to display the survey question distributions for Questions 45 and 46, regarding citizens' perceptions of their land rights. Eventually we hope to analyze these in the context of the various Landmark indices/explore the overlap. We hope this information would best serve NGO's so that they can help citizens take appropriate action to protect their land.

Data Analysis (summary of interesting results): TBD

Conclusion (short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work): TBD
