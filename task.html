  <p> During our interview with Alfred (our community partner), we decided to
    ask him about his specific goals regarding the indices, and we found that he is
    trying to determine a ranking that can help NGO's drive reform. He is looking
    to develop an index that can better inform NGO's about ways to help citizens
    of the various African countries have a clearer idea of their land rights
    and defend them in the most effective ways. </p>
