  <p> We are exploring data from eight African countries: BurkinaFaso, Cameroon,
     Coted_Ivoire, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Zambia. For each
      of these countries, we have data from a survey responses (from a Land
      Alliance for Properties of People and Places) for approximately 84
      questions. These survey responses are broken down into sections, based on
      areas involving: a general screening/background, respondent profile,
      tenure assessment of dwelling, tenure security perceptions, documentation,
  benefits of tenure security, and property rights context and perceptions. </p>

  <p>For the purpose of this iteration, we chose to dive deeper into certain
     survey responses that kept track of citizens' perceptions of their land
      rights vs. the "true" security of their land, as determined by various
      indices described in a dataset from Landmark (A Global Platform of
       Indigenous and Community land). This Landmark data is a series of ten
       indicator questions that investigate the security of land tenure for
       indigenous communities. Each indicator is determined based on a review of
        several related factors such as national laws, regulations, statutes,
         etc. The indicators are then scored from 1 - 4 based on how much the
         relevant laws address the issues at hand, (one being highest, four
   being lowest in the sense that the laws do not address the issue). </p>

<p> The indicator scores are all numeric, and all the countries are categorical.
   In addition, the survey responses that we explored are also numeric, as we
   compiled the total counts for each question's possible responses, in order
      to visualize their distributions.</p>
