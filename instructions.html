  <p>
    1. Select 1 - 3 countries from the eight African countries we display below the violin plots.<br>
    2. Next select the Question you'd like to highlight the distribution for. <br>
    3. Select the Indicator you'd like to overlay the survey distribution for. <br> <br>

    Initially, the visualization is grayed out before any user interactions. Clicking on a country populates the chart above with three corresponding sets of violin plots. We chose to display violin visualizations for both sets of survey responses - for Questions 45 and 46 of the Prindex Land Rights Survey (more info on that below under the "Data" section). So, for example - if you select two countries such as Liberia and Rwanda, violin plots for both questions will appear side-by-side. Then, under the "Prindex Land Rights Survey" section, you can select either Question 45 or Question 46, and the appropriate plots for both will be outlined. You can further interact with the "Indicators of the Legal Security of Indigenous and Community Lands" radio buttons, in order to choose which of the 10 indicators to overlap the violin plots with. We apply a color gradient to the violin plots based on how strong the overlap between these indices and the survey responses are.

You can also navigate to the pages in the upper nav bar for further information on motivation, data notes, analysis, and our design process. </p>
