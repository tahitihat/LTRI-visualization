  <p> Future work - Given our limited domain knowledge and time constraints,
    it is difficult to truly generalize about these countries' land and legal
    security. If presented with more time/resources/background knowledge, our
    next goal would be to consolidate all of the indicator scores to create a
    'macro'-level score for each country. This would hopefully help inform
    NGO's and locals in these African countries of their land security.
    In order to do so, we would need to collect more information on the
    meaning of each of the ten scores, and explore ways to weight them in
    a meaningful way. </p>
