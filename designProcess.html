  <p> Since our last sprint, we revised our design for the purposes of this
    visualization. From meeting with Prof. Sprague, we decided to construct a
    visualization displaying the distribution of various survey answers from the
    LTSI survey responses. The following is the user flow we are attempting to
    build: First, a user clicks on the country shapes that they would like to
    compare survey responses for (ideally we will cap this at 3 countries).
    Next, the user can select the radio button corresponding to the survey
    question they'd like to view the distributions for. The user can also
    select a radio button corresponding to the types of indicators they'd
    like to compare country survey data distributions against (as outlined in
    the Landmark data). These indicators are scores for ten fields including:
    <br> &middot;Legal Status
    <br> &middot;Land Rights & Common Property
    <br> &middot;Formal Documentation
    <br> &middot;Legal Person
    <br> &middot;Legal Authority
    <br> &middot;Perpetuity
    <br> &middot;Right to Consent Before Land Acquisition
    <br> &middot;Rights to Trees
    <br> &middot;Rights to Water
    <br> &middot;Land Rights in Protected Areas
    <br> We plan to have these tag lines for each score, along with a quick
    description of what information the score measures.</p>

  <p> We decided to create violin plots to convey the data distributions since
    they allow for easy visualization of data across several groups. They are
    also convenient and adapt well for large datasets. Violin plots are a
    combination of box plots and a probability density mirrored on an axis,
    to show the distribution shape of the data. </p>

  <p> We are using JS (D3 Library)/HTML/CSS for the UI. We use
    <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/violin_basicHist.html"> this </a>
    as a guideline for the violin plot. </p>
